            <p>Success, it doesn’t start with S. It starts with W — as in work. When life throws you a burger, eat it. Came here for a burger after work</p>

    <h2>My Recipes</h2>
    <p>A recipe has no soul. You as the cook must bring soul to the recipe. Real cooking is more about following your heart than following recipes. So when people ask me, What do you think of Bishal?- I don’t cook for guides. I cook for customers.</p>

        <h2>Sandwich</h2>
        <p>The only real stumbling block is fear of failure. In cooking, you’ve got to have a what-the-hell attitude.</p>

        <h2>Set-Menu</h2>
        <p>Cooking demands attention, patience, and above all, a respect for the gifts of the earth. It is a form of worship, a way of giving thanks.</p>
